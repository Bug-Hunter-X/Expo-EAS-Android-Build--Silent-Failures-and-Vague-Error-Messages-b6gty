This error occurs when using Expo CLI and you encounter issues related to the `eas build` command, specifically when building an Android APK.  The build process might fail silently or produce vague error messages, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.  This often involves issues with Android dependencies, Gradle configurations, or even misconfigurations within the Expo project setup itself.
