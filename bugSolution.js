The solution involves several steps:
1. **Enable verbose logging:** Increase the verbosity of the EAS build logs to get more detailed output during the build process.  This might help expose hidden errors.
2. **Check the EAS build logs:** Look closely at the complete build log. It might contain subtle error messages related to dependency resolution, Gradle configuration problems, or conflicts with native modules. 
3. **Inspect the Gradle files:** Manually check your `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files for any potential misconfigurations, such as incorrect dependency versions or missing plugins.
4. **Clean and rebuild:**  Try cleaning the project's build directory before rebuilding.  This might resolve transient issues.
5. **Simplify the project:** Create a minimal reproducible example (MRE) by removing non-essential features, dependencies, and packages to isolate the problem. 
6. **Isolate the issue:**  Experimentally disable or remove native modules one by one to determine if any cause a conflict during the build process. 
7. **Examine the Expo SDK version and dependencies:** Ensure that the Expo SDK version is up to date and that all dependencies are compatible with the chosen Expo SDK.
8. **Check the Android environment:** Ensure that your Android development environment is correctly set up, including the necessary Android SDK tools and Android Studio components. 
9. **Consult the Expo documentation:** Refer to the official Expo documentation for troubleshooting tips and known issues related to Android builds.
10. **Search for similar issues:** Look for similar issues reported on the Expo forums, GitHub issues, or Stack Overflow to see if there are existing solutions.
